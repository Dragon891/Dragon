		<h3>The Typhoomerang is a Stoker Class dragon that appears in the How to Train Your Dragon (Franchise). Typhoomerangs have a unique ability during flight: they rotate (by analogy with the typhoon/ boomerang) at high speeds, zooming through the air. Though, as they rotate, they seem to pop off the objects around them, making them extremely dangerous. Ash from their burning takeoffs leaves a distinctive burn on the ground. The ash apparently acts as a fertilizer; plants and flowers may grow in the burn mark afterwards. They are the only dragon known to prey on eels. A notable example of this species of dragons is Torch, who was named by Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, and trained by Hiccup and the other riders. Fishlegs is the one who names the Typhoomerang it's name!
<br>
<br>

Typhoomerangs are very large dragons, and they come in a variety of colors including blue/blun-green, yellow, red, and orange. They have two large horns and orange eyes. The legs are exactly like that of a Monstrous Nightmare. They look like a mix-breed of a Monstrous Nightmare and a Timberjack.
<br>
<br>
As a baby, a Typhoomerang has a measured wingspan that reaches 20 inches long. Until a fully grown Typhoomerang was spotted by Hiccup and his Dragon Riders, they thought that the baby Typhoomerang, Torch, was already fully grown. Much to their surprise, fully grown Typhoomerangs can reach an outstanding difference in size from a juvenile. Adult Typhoomerangs reach huge sizes, and they grow up fast as well. The size of adult Typhoomerang is taller then trees though the size chart stated to be 28ft but possible tall as 30ft tall.
<br>
<br>
A Titan Wing Typhoomerang is mainly black in color, with some grey patches around its wings. Its longer horns are red at the tip and the folds on its segmented belly are red too. The tip and the bones in its wings appear to be red too. Their feet have red claws and a what appears to be a sail at the back of the legs.

<br>
<br>
Typhoomerangs are high-strung, hot headed and passionate dragons, and they can be extremely dangerous, or becoming overly dramatic attention hogs. Their flame spirals can be used as a territory marker, or as a mating display. Like all dragons, Typhoomerangs are extremely protective of their young and their riders. They protect smaller creatures from harm by folding their wings tightly into a cocoon-like casing and tucking their heads under their wings.

<br>
<br>
Typhoomerangs have tornado-like fire, and can ignite their bodies like a Monstrous Nightmare to perform a corkscrew lunge. The dragon is immune to eels due to its eating them and instead uses them to replenish its fire shots. Typhoomerangs also can fly nearly as fast as a Night Fury. However, they cannot maneuver as well as smaller dragons due to their large wings. Thus, they are unable to pull out of a deep dive. They also have incredible endurance.Watch the video below.
